Now I am a backend RD (Research & Develop Engineer) at **[ByteDance](https://bytedance.com/)** company. Prior to that, I received my bachelor (B.E. in computer science) degree from **[SUSTech](http://sustech.edu.cn/)** as an **Outstanding Graduate**, under the supervision of **[Prof.Bo Tang](https://acm.sustech.edu.cn/btang)**. I was once a research assistant in University of California, Irvine ISG (Information Systems Group), participated in the development of the big data visualization middeleware **[Cloudberry](http://cloudberry.ics.uci.edu/)**, supervised by **[Prof. Chen Li](https://chenli.ics.uci.edu)** and **[Prof. Shuang Zhao](https://shuangz.com)**. I have published one demo paper in **[VLDB](http://www.vldb.org/)** conference(CCF-A), and won bronze medal in **[ACM-ICPC](https://icpc.global/)** EC final.
